# Yelp-Dataset-Challenge
Analysis of the Yelp Dataset using MongoDB, Neo4j and SAS to propose new metrics and improve existing ones for enhanced business and user experience.

- This project is intended to propose new analytical metrics, improvements on the existing metrics and a new webpage designs for businesses & reviewers - all based on the Yelp dataset  

- MongoDB (No SQL) to perform analysis: the overall number of reviews, the overall number of reviews with ratings more than 3/less than 3/average, top 10 most prolific/verbose reviewers, implication of positive (>3) reviews vs negative (<3), text-based vs non text-based analyses on review text  

- Neo4j (Graph database) to analyze if geographical proximity was leading to uniformity in business ratings or divergence, mob effect on the overall rating by reviewers  -Defining a good reviewer (Elite reviewers vs helpful reviewers) 

- SAS enterprise miner to build a definition to identify fake reviews
